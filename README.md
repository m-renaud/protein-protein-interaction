# Protein-protein Interaction #

This repository will contain some of the code that I wrote during my
NSERC USRA grant.

Areas include:
* FASTA file format parsing
* PDB file parsing
* Finding protein complex interation interfaces
* Gibbs Sampling implementation for One-per-sequnece and
  Many-per-sequence

## Note ##

As the term is not yet over, the code is not yet publicly
available. This will change at the end of August 2012.
